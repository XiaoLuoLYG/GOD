# Class Learn

This is a real executable GOD agent skill. Its local `skill.json` describes
its own targets, interaction preferences, status changes, speech template,
memory template, and fallback strategy. `scripts/run_skill.py` returns a
standard `SkillResult`; the JiuwenClawAgent runtime validates and applies the
result to movement, interaction, speech, state, and memory.
